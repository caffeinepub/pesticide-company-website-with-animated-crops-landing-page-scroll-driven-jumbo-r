# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the header brand logo image visibly larger for better readability while staying fully contained within the existing header height (h-16).

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust only the selected header logo `<img>` element styling/attributes to increase its rendered size (e.g., height/width constraints) so it appears more prominent.
- Ensure the resized logo remains fully contained in the header across common viewport widths (no overflow or clipping).

**User-visible outcome:** The header logo appears noticeably larger and easier to read at a glance, while still fitting cleanly within the header without being cut off.
