  "summary": "The diff increases the logo <img> size via Tailwind classes, but it also changes other elements in the header (the wrapping <Link> and adds an extra <span>), which conflicts with REQ-12’s constraint that only the selected logo <img> element be modified. The use of negative margins on the <img> also introduces risk of overflow/clipping relative to the fixed header height requirement.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Only the selected logo <img> element styling/attributes are modified; no unrelated header/nav elements are changed.",
      "reason": "TopNav changes include modifications to the wrapping link element and insertion of an additional accessibility span, which are outside the specified <img> element.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "The logo image remains fully contained within the header (no vertical overflow/clipping) across common viewport widths.",
      "reason": "The <img> is given `h-16` (same as the header height) plus `-my-2` negative vertical margins, which can cause the rendered box to extend beyond the header height and potentially overflow/clamp depending on header overflow behavior; the diff does not show any containment/overflow handling to guarantee the AC.",

      "description": "Changed the homepage brand link styling (added hover opacity/transition and `py-2`).",
      "reason": "REQ-12 restricts changes to the logo <img> element only; modifying the enclosing <Link> is an unrelated header change.",

    {
      "description": "Added an extra `sr-only` span label ('AgriProtect Home') next to the logo.",
